                            Hello! My name is Nich (short for Nicholas), I have been writing code
                            for almost a year now and I enjoy it more and more each day. I started
                            this process on a whim last September by taking a Programing 109 course
                            at Bellevue College. Never before had a class motivated me to work and
                            study so easily, I was hooked. In the months leading up to this course I
                            have been learning whatever I can on my own, but I am very much looking
                            forward to formal training with structure to ensure I don't miss
                            anything important.
                        </p>

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Outside of school my enjoy spending time with my friends, girlfriend,
                            and family doing just about anything, I'm not picky. My favorite
                            pastimes include skiing (above all else), hiking, food and drink (namely
                            beer, bourbon, and wine), traveling and playing both video and card
                            games.
                        </p>

                            The parts of Web Development that I enjoy most so far are front-end and
                            design oriented but I want to become more familiar with the back-end
                            processes as well as making complex applications with JS. I know I have
                            so much to learn and I can't wait to get started!
